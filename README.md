# Preparation exercise for test

The goal of this exercise is to prepare for the test on Monday 3/1/2022.

Objective: having a design/wireframe, turn it into html and css code. No CSS-Frameworks allowed. I will use Sass though for easier and faster workflow.

The page I am going to create consists a header, a nav, a main content with section(s) and/or aside and a footer.

I will try to give the page a nice structure with enough spacing around each element/block. Max-width of the content will be 80%.
